This is aimed to be a plugin for blender to generate 4 angle hologram videos
to be used with a reflection pyramid made from 4 low opacity triangles (like
cd cover plastics)

install fholorend as an addon to blender and render images using fholorend
(look at blender's website for how to import addons)

use `sh -c img2vid.sh render-root-dir` to generate video
